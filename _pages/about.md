I am PhD candidate in Sociology at [the Centre for Sociological Research](https://soc.kuleuven.be/ceso) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) in Belgium.

Research
------
As a computational social scientist, I apply data science tools and methods to social science research questions.  My methodological interests range widely from latent variable models, causal inference with observational and experimental data, agent-based modeling, social network analysis, and survey methodology. My applied research revolves around labour market inequalities and welfare attitudes in Europe.

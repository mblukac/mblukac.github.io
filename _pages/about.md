As the Co-founder, Chief Scientist, and CTO of [Koios](https://getkoios.ai), my journey in AI and deep learning is built upon a rich foundation of computational social science and a profound commitment to using technology for social good. Before embarking on the path that led me to [Koios](https://getkoios.ai), I developed my expertise at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com), focusing on leveraging machine learning for issues like fraud detection, using designing experiments for causal inference in health insurance, and pioneering the use of deep learning for disease prediction. My academic pursuits as an LSE Fellow in Computational Social Science at [the Department of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) at [the London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/), and as an Associate at [the Institute for New Economic Thinking](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk) at [the University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk), have been instrumental in shaping my perspective on and knowledge of AI as a technology. I earned my PhD from [the Centre for Sociological Research](https://soc.kuleuven.be/ceso) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) in Belgium, where I delved into the complexities of labor market inequalities, redistribution preferences, and welfare attitudes across Europe, integrating computational methods with social science to uncover new insights into societal challenges.

Research
------
My research philosophy is anchored in the belief that technological advancement and social research must intersect to address the most pressing issues of our time, including social inequalities and the evolving dynamics of labor markets and welfare systems. This conviction drives my work at Koios Labs, where I pioneer the field of Psychometric AI. By applying deep learning and generative AI technologies, my research aims to craft innovative tools for understanding and enhancing human interactions, with a special focus on extracting psychological insights from voice data. This work extends to predicting not only psychological traits such as personality, passion, impulsiveness, but also psychological states such as stress, all within the ethical framework of AI for good. I am highly interested in how these measurements can be used to craft the most efficient teams that do their best work.

My background in studying labor market inequalities, redistribution preferences, and welfare attitudes in Europe deeply informs our approach at Koios, ensuring that our AI technologies are developed with a keen awareness of their social implications. As we advance in creating AI that personalises digital interactions and understands human needs at a profound level, my prior research on societal structures and disparities remains a guiding light, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity, ethics, and beneficence in technology development. This blend of cutting-edge AI research with a grounded understanding of social science challenges positions us uniquely to redefine human connection in the digital age, making technology a force for societal improvement and human well-being.
